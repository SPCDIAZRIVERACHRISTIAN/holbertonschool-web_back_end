# Python Variable Annotations

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate the use of variable annotations. Variable annotations are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allow you to add type hints to your variables, function parameters, and return values. These annotations can help improve code readability and facilitate static type checking.

## Files

- `8-make_multiplier.py`: Contains a function that returns a function to multiply a float by a given multiplier.
- `9-element_length.py`: Contains a function that returns a list of tuples, each containing an element from the input iterable and its length.

## Usage

To run the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py

Replace <script_name> with the name of the script you want to run.

Style Guide
The code in this directory follows the PEP 8 style guide. You can check for style compliance using pycodestyle:
pycodestyle <script_name>.py
Replace <script_name> with the name of the script you want to check.
